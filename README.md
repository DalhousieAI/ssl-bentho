# BenthicNet Self-Supervised Learning

## Purpose
This repo exists to document and demonstrate how self-supervised models were prepared for BenthicNet. 
The code leverages the [Solo-learn](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn) library for implementation of SSL methods.

## Getting Started
To install benthicnet utility functions, use
```
python -m pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:DalhousieAI/BenthicNet.git
```
If seeking to use the code presented here, please see [Solo-learn](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn) for instructions in installing this library and its dependencies (this code repository was tested with solo-learn=1.0.6).
For the remainder library dependencies, see requirements.txt.
